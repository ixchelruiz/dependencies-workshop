# dependencies-workshop
The benefit of software dependencies is that they allow developers to deliver software faster by  building on previous code. Dependencies are an integral part of the software development cycle and they will be used at different stages i.e. development, execution or testing. Yet dependencies not only may introduce risks that are often overlooked, but their fast resolution and compliance with license types must be taken into consideration. In this session we will review the types of dependencies out there, tools that help us resolve them quickly and securely.
